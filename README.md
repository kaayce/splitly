# Splitly
### App for splitting bills with friendsðŸ¥°

## Project overview
Splitly is a Web app for splitting bills with friendsðŸ¥°

## App Setup
### Frontend
    - Navigate to the frontend directory and run:
      - pnpm install
      - pnpm dev, app should be available on http://localhost:5173
### Backend
    The backend requires **Docker** and **Docker Compose** to run the database.
    - Navigate to the backend directory and do the following:
        - For first time setup:
          - `make init` to install dependencies, load the database fixtures
          - `make start` to start the container, generate schema, migrate & seed the database, and start the server.
          - You can find useful information about the Makefile commands within the Makefile itself.
        - For subesequent runs:
            - `pnpm dev`  to start the server.
            - `pnpm db:push` to push the schema to the database.

## Limitations:
To reduce scope and complexity, the app has the following limitations:
- Most of the data on the backend is generated for faster development.
- There is no authentication or authorization, However there is a helpful user management button to manage users.
- The split functionality is limited to splitting bills equally among friends.
- The split functionality automatically calculates the share of each user based on the total bill amount and updates balance for each user based on their contributions.
